    <p>Even though Israel is a small country it is always in the news.
          The news continues to report on Jews moving to Israel, on the 
          technology invented there, but also on conflict, wars and tensions 
          with surrounding people.  Why? A look at Israelâ€™s history in the book
           of Genesis in the Bible reveals that 4000 years ago a man, who is now 
           very well known, went on a camping trip in that part of the world.  
           The Bible says that his story affects our future.</p>
